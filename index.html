                <h2>Bubbles</h2>
               <p>Bubbles is a born again Quackhead after choking on bread thrown by a non Holy Duck member during a pond protest in 2003. 
                Bubbles lost her faith in the cult but returned  many years later. Fate brought her back, after stumbling upon a rubber duck relic. (WHICH WE PROVIDE PURCHASE OPPPORTUNIES BELOW BTW)
               </p>She has since returned to the cult and is our most active loyal follower of the Holy Duck. Her favorite saying is "water off a ducks back."
